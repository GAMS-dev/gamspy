The Nurse Assignment Problem (NURSES)

Nurses must be assigned to hospital shifts in accordance with various staffing constraints.
The goal of the model is to find an efficient balance between the different objectives:
* minimize the overall cost of the plan and
* assign shifts as fairly as possible.
