class Options(BaseModel):
    """
    Options class to set GAMS options for the model.

    Attributes
    ----------

    cns: str | None
        Default **cns** solver
    dnlp: str | None
        Default **dnlp** solver
    emp: str | None
        Default **emp** solver
    lp: str | None
        Default **lp** solver
    mcp: str | None
        Default **mcp** solver
    minlp: str | None
        Default **minlp** solver
    mip: str | None
        Default **mip** solver
    miqcp: str | None
        Default **miqcp** solver
    mpec: str | None
        Default **mpec** solver
    nlp: str | None
        Default **nlp** solver
    qcp: str | None
        Default **qcp** solver
    rminlp: str | None
        Default **rminlp** solver
    rmip: str | None
        Default **rmip** solver
    rmiqcp: str | None
        Default **rmiqcp** solver
    rmpec: str | None
        Default **rmpec** solver
    allow_suffix_in_equation: bool | None
        Flag to allow variables with suffixes in model algebra
    allow_suffix_in_limited_variables: bool | None
        Flag to allow **domain limited variables** with suffixes in model
    basis_detection_threshold: float | None
        Basis detection threshold
    compile_error_limit: int = 1
        Compile time error limit
    domain_violation_limit: int | None
        Domain violation limit
    cutoff: float | None
        Within a branch-and-bound based solver, the parts of the tree with an objective value worse than
        the cutoff value are ignored. Note that this may speed up the initial phase of the branch and
        bound algorithm (before the first integer solution is found). However, the true optimum may be
        beyond the cutoff value. In this case the true optimum will be missed and moreover, no solution
        will be found. Observe that this option is specified in absolute terms.
    default_point: int | None
        This option determines the point that is passed to the solver as a basis. By default, the levels
        and marginals from the current basis are passed to the solver. In some circumstances (mostly during debugging),
        it can be useful to pass a standard default input point, i.e. with all levels set to 0 or lower bound.

        * **Option 0**	Pass user defined levels and marginals to solver

        * **Option 1**	Pass default levels and marginals to solver

        * **Option 2**	Pass default marginals to solver
    generate_name_dict: bool | None
        If this option is set, it will instruct GAMS to make the GAMS names
        of variables and equations that have been generated by the solve statement
        available to the solver. In many solver links, these names are registered
        with the solver and hence messages from the solver that involve variables
        and equations (e.g. an infeasible row or duplicate columns) can be easily
        interpreted by the user. However, the dictionary comes at a price.
        Generating the names and calculating and storing the map takes time and space.
        In addition, GAMS names take up space in the solver. Thus, if the user needs
        very fast generation and does not need names, setting dictFile to zero is a
        good option.
    enable_scaling: bool | None
        This option determines whether GAMS will employ user-specified variable and equation scaling factors.
        It must be set to True if scaling factors are to be used.
    enable_prior: bool | None
        Instructs the solver to use the priority branching information passed by GAMS through variable suffix 
        values variable.prior. If and how priorities are used is solver-dependent.
    infeasibility_tolerance: float | None
        This option sets the tolerance for marking an equation infeasible in the equation listing. By default, 
        1.0e-13.
    try_partial_integer_solution: bool | None
        Signals the solver to make use of a partial or near-integer-feasible solution stored in current variable 
        values to get a quick integer-feasible point. The exact form of implementation depends on the solver and 
        may be partly controlled by solver settings or options. See the solver manuals for details.
    examine_linearity: bool | None
        Examine empirical NLP model to see if there are any NLP terms active. If there are none the default LP 
        solver will be used. If this option is set to True, empirical NLP models will be examined to determine 
        if there are any active NLP terms. If there are none, the default LP solver will be used. The procedure 
        also checks to see if QCP and DNLP models can be reduced to an LP; MIQCP and MINLP can be solved as a MIP; 
        RMIQCP and RMINLP can be solved as an RMIP.
    hold_fixed_variables: bool | None
        Treat fixed variables as constants
    iteration_limit: int | None
        Iteration limit of solver
    keep_temporary_files: bool = False
        Controls keeping or deletion of process directory and scratch files
    listing_file: str | None
        Listing file name
    loadpoint: str | None
        Path to the loadpoint GDX file that contains starting point records.
    log_file: str | None
        Log file name
    variable_listing_limit: int
        Maximum number of columns listed in one variable block
    equation_listing_limit: int
        Maximum number of rows listed in one equation block
    min_improvement_threshold: float | None
        For a branch-and-bound based solver, each new feasible solution must be at least the value of min_improvement_threshold
        better than the current best feasible solution. Note that this may speed up the search, but may cause some solutions,
        including optimal ones, to be missed. If a model has been solved with a nonzero min_improvement_threshold, then the
        optimal solution will be within the min_improvement_threshold or less of the found solution. Observe that the option
        min_improvement_threshold is specified in absolute terms, therefore non-negative values are appropriate for both
        minimization and maximization models.
    miro_protect:
        Protects MIRO input symbol records from being re-assigned, by default True.
    node_limit: int | None

        Wall-clock time limit for solver
    savepoint: Optional[Literal[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]] = None
        Save solver point in GDX file

        * **Option 0**: No point GDX file is to be saved

        * **Option 1**: A point GDX file from the last solve is to be saved

        * **Option 2**: A point GDX file from every solve is to be saved

        * **Option 3**: A point GDX file from the last solve is to be saved in the scratch directory

        * **Option 0**: Remove solution listings following solves

        * **Option 1**: Include solution listings following solves

    show_os_memory: Literal[0, 1, 2] = 0
        Show the memory usage reported by the Operating System instead of the internal counting

        * **Option 0**: Show memory reported by internal accounting

        * **Option 2**: Show virtual set size reported by operating system
    solve_link_type: Optional[Literal["disk", "memory"]] = None
        Solver link option

        * **disk**: Model instance saved to scratch directory, the solver is called with a spawn (if possible) or a shell (if spawn is not possible) while GAMS remains open - If this is not supported by the selected solver, it gets reset to **1** automatically

        * **memory**: The model instance is passed to the solver in-memory - If this is not supported by the selected solver, it gets reset to **disk** automatically.
    merge_strategy: Optional[Literal["replace", "merge", "clear"]] = None
        * **Replace**: The solution information for all equations and variables is merged into the existing solution information

        * **Merge**: The solution information for all equations appearing in the model is completely replaced by the new model results; variables are only replaced if they appear in the final model

        * **Clear**: The solution information for all equations appearing in the model is completely replaced; in addition, variables appearing in the symbolic equations but removed by conditionals will be removed
