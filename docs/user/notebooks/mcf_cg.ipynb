    "# Multi-Commodity Flow Problem (MCF) with Column Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Multi-Commodity Flow Problem** is a classic optimization problem in network science and operations research. It involves determining the optimal way to transport multiple distinct commodities through a shared network while minimizing costs, subject to constraints like capacity and demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of the MCF Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nodes**: Represent locations (e.g., cities, warehouses, factories).\n",
    "- **Edges**: Represent the connections between locations (e.g., roads, pipelines, communication links).\n",
    "- **Capacities**: The maximum flow that each edge can handle (e.g., 20 trucks per day, 100 Mbps bandwidth).\n",
    "- **Commodities**: Different types of goods, resources, or flows (e.g., water, energy, data packets) that need to be transported.\n",
    "- **Cost**: The expense of transporting a unit of a commodity along an edge.\n",
    "- **Demand**: The required amount of each commodity that must be transported from a specific source node to a target node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the MCF problem is to find the optimal flow of multiple commodities through a network while minimizing the total cost, subject to:\n",
    "- **Capacity Constraints**: The total flow on any edge cannot exceed its capacity.\n",
    "- **Demand Satisfaction**: Each commodity must be transported from its source node to its sink node in the required quantity.\n",
    "- **Flow Conservation**: The flow of a commodity entering a node (other than the source or sink) must equal the flow leaving that node."

    "## Limitations of the Traditional Multi-Commodity Flow Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "While the traditional edge-based formulation of the **Multi-Commodity Flow Problem (MCF)** is straightforward and intuitive, it has several drawbacks when applied to large-scale networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalability Issues**: The number of decision variables increases rapidly with the size of the network (nodes, edges, and commodities).\n",
    "2. **Memory Overhead**: Large-scale problems require significant memory to store the decision variables and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Column Generation and Path Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these limitations, **Column Generation** provides a more efficient way to solve large-scale MCF problems. Instead of working with all possible paths at once, the **path-based formulation** generates paths dynamically during the solution process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path Formulation of MCF\n",
    "\n",
    "In the path-based formulation, the focus shifts from edges to **complete paths** that commodities can take between their source and sink. Key advantages include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduced Problem Size**:\n",
    "   - Only a subset of feasible paths is considered in the Restricted Master Problem (RMP), reducing the number of decision variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Path Generation**:\n",
    "   - New paths are added iteratively as needed through a **Pricing Problem**. This ensures that only paths with potential to improve the solution are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Column Generation Works?\n",
    "\n",
    "Column Generation is an iterative optimization approach that alternates between:\n",
    "1. **Solving the Restricted Master Problem (RMP)**:\n",
    "   - The RMP is solved using only a limited set of paths.\n",
    "   - Dual variables from the RMP are used to calculate reduced costs for potential new paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Solving the Pricing Problem**:\n",
    "   - A shortest path problem (or its equivalent) is solved to identify new paths with negative reduced cost.\n",
    "   - If such paths exist, they are added to the RMP, and the process repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stopping Criterion**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm terminates when no new paths with negative reduced cost can be found."

    "## Defining Initial and Possible Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the **Column Generation (CG)** algorithm, we require a feasible solution as a starting point. This is achieved by defining **initial paths** that connect the source node to the sink node for each commodity. These initial paths ensure the problem is solvable from the outset, even if some paths are not practically feasible. But the following points need to be considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost Handling**:\n",
    "   - If a path physically exists in the network (as per the problem's data), the actual cost from the problem is used.\n",
    "   - If a direct path between the source and sink does not exist, a very high cost is assigned to discourage its use in the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Purpose of Initial Paths**:\n",
    "   - To guarantee a feasible solution to the Restricted Master Problem (RMP) at the start of the column generation process.\n",
