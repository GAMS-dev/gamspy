GAMSPy heralds a new era of possibilities, offering a bridge between machine
learning and optimization that was previously challenging to traverse with GAMS
alone. Here's why GAMSPy stands out as the ultimate choice:

* Versatility in Solver Selection: You can try different solvers

* It provides a strong algebraic language allows you to play with how neural network is implemented

* GAMSPy's implementation is more flexible:

  * You are not limited with inference, you can try training your neural-network.

  * You can build the architecture from scratch in GAMSPy

* GAMSPy generates the equations and variables in GAMS not in Python giving GAMSPy a speed advantage
